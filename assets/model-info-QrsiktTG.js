`,e.jsx(i.h3,{children:"1. Arithmetic (Linear)"}),`
`,e.jsx(i.p,{children:"This model assumes a linear growth or decline rate of Bitcoin prices over time. It's the simplest model and typically used for short-term forecasts. It also happens to be irrelevant, as nothing in finance and economics follows a Linear path but it is included for completeness."}),`
`,e.jsx(i.h3,{children:"2. Quadratic (Polynomial)"}),`
`,e.jsx(i.p,{children:"This model captures curvature in price trends by including a squared term, allowing for acceleration or deceleration in price changes, which may reflect market cycles more accurately than a linear model, but is generally still wanting."}),`
`,e.jsx(i.h3,{children:"3. Power Law Regression Median (Logarithmic)"}),`
`,e.jsx(i.p,{children:"This model uses a power law applied to the median values of historical price data, assuming that price changes are proportional to current prices at a constant rate. It's useful for long-term predictions and highlighting potential price scales."}),`
