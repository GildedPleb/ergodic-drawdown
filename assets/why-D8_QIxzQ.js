`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Most bitcoin projection tools, such as price models (S2F, Power Law, Rainbow, etc) or Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) calculators, often rely on uniform assumptions about returns. This means that drawdown--which are path-dependent, can not be accurately modeled. These models typically portray a constant rate of return and evenly distributed market conditions over time. However, Bitcoin markets are inherently volatile (which is good) and exhibit non-uniform return behavior, where large swings in value can occur unpredictably. An Ergodic Bitcoin Drawdown via a Monte Carlo Simulation embraces this non-uniformity by simulating a multitude of potential future scenarios, incorporating the possibility of drastic ups and downs in Bitcoin's price, which can significantly alter the sustainability of withdrawals."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"In short, though a Power Law Model might be an entire philosophical understanding of bitcoins growth, it remains practically useless until we know pathing inside the model. A monte carlo simulator provides this."}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Often enough the bitcoin community does not account for probability in models when they interpret a model. To illustrate, some might look at the Stock To Flow model and claim it is disproven simply by the improbability the actual path pricing has taken. The error here is that the model itself presents probabilistic bands of likely outcomes, it does not predict the actual pathing itself. Though a path might be unlikely, that does not invalidate a model which is attempting to account for any number of paths."}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:'I do not think it is a stretch to interpret the Power Law Support Line as a response to this effect. Instead of focusing on the power law median and showing how price might fluctuate around it, Power Law Support focuses on the limit and instead says "Though Shall Not Pass". Both of these suffer the same error of thinking in terms of certainties not probabilities. A Monte Carlo Simulator breaks one from this thinking.'}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"With regard to drawdowns, simpler models often overlook the concept of path dependency in financial planning. Path dependency implies that the sequence of returns matters significantly; a substantial drop in Bitcoin’s price early in the withdrawal phase can deplete capital to a level from which it may never recover, even if subsequent returns are strong. For example, if a user begins to draw down on their Bitcoin holdings and experiences a 40% market drop within the first year, the reduced capital base means there is less capital to benefit from potential future recoveries, altering the trajectory of their holdings permanently. Traditional models that average out returns might miss this risk by projecting a smoother path."}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"Most conventional tools use historical average returns and standard deviation in a symmetrical, often Gaussian distribution. However, Bitcoin's returns do not fit neatly into these standard parameters; they are better modeled with fat-tailed distributions and quantiles which are indicative of non-uniform higher probabilities of extreme values. The Monte Carlo simulation used in this Ergodic Bitcoin Drawdown tool allows for the adjustment of volatility parameters more closely aligned with Bitcoin’s historical performance, actual markets, and reality, providing a more nuanced view of potential future states."}),`

`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:"While FIRE calculators and price models provide a generalized static overview, the Monte Carlo method enables detailed scenario analysis under varying conditions of market behavior, drawdown strategies, and personal financial dynamics. For instance, the Rainbow Model though intuitive and useful, can not actually provide insight with regard to selling and buying because this insight is path dependent and contextually constrained. Users can adjust this simulator for different levels of aggressiveness in spending strategies, varying inflation rates, and changes in market conditions over time, making it a far more flexible and informative tool for planning."}),`

It ensures that the model considers the entire distribution of possible outcomes rather than just an average path, helping to plan for extremes rather than just medians. This approach is beneficial for users who need to understand the worst-case scenarios as much as the average or expected outcomes."}),`
