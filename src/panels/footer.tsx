            Start (%) is the % offset between the first-affordable week and
            last-unaffordable week for a drawdown event. As their names suggest,
            these two events in sequential price data form two meaningful date
            bounds for spending on each sample. The default Start (%) is 100,
            meaning spend on the last-unaffordable day. Be cautions about any %
            that's not 0 or 100, as many could mean spending more bitcoin than
            you might like! Delay, is an additional weekly delay from the start
            point.

              Q: What is drawdown in the context of Bitcoin financial modeling?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawdown refers to the reduction in one's Bitcoin holdings as a
            result of withdrawals or expenditures. In financial terms, it's the
            peak-to-trough decline during a specific recorded period of an
            investment. In the context of Bitcoin financial modeling, such as on
            this website using Monte Carlo simulations, drawdown specifically
            addresses how much Bitcoin balance decreases over time due to
            regular withdrawals to meet expenses or other financial obligations.

              Q: What does "ergodic" mean in the context of this Bitcoin
              drawdown tool?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ergodic" is a term often used in statistics, mathematics, and
            physics to describe systems or processes where, given enough time,
            they cover all possible states or configurations. It implies that
            the time average of a process is equivalent to its average over its
            entire space of states. In simpler terms, an ergodic process is one
            where every part of the system, or every outcome, is eventually
            sampled over time. This concept is fundamental in areas like
            thermodynamics, where it helps in understanding how gases behave,
            and in economics and finance for modeling market behaviors and
            predictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of this tool, "ergodic" refers to the assumption that
            over a long period, the average results of the Bitcoin price
            simulations will represent the ensemble average across many
            different economic scenarios. This concept is critical in ensuring
            that the projections made by the tool reflect a comprehensive range
            of possible futures, not just a single trajectory.
          </p>

            <strong>
              Q: How does the Monte Carlo simulation method work for an Ergodic
              drawdown?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Monte Carlo simulation method involves running a large number of
            simulations ('walks') to forecast the future behavior of Bitcoin
            prices. By inputting different parameters like volatility and walk
            strategies, the tool generates multiple potential outcomes, helping
            to illustrate the range of possible scenarios for Bitcoin holdings
            over time, and their associated probability.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q: What is meant by 'walks' in this simulation?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            'Walks' refer to individual iterations of the Monte Carlo
            simulation, where the Bitcoin price is projected forward in time
            based on predefined volatility, strategy, and other factors. Each
            walk represents a single possible future path that Bitcoin's price
            might take, contributing to the broader statistical analysis of
            potential outcomes. Some walks themselves are ergodic in that they
            attempt to eventually hit both the bottom (min) and top (max) of the
            given model, which usually corresponds to around 1st percentile and
            99th percentile. However, these boundaries are not always respected
            or enforced.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Q: Why is understanding quantiles important in analyzing the
              simulation results?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Quantiles are points or values that divide a dataset into groups
            containing equal numbers of data points, or that represent specific
            proportions of the dataset. They are useful in statistics for
            understanding the distribution and spread of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quantiles, here, are essential for understanding the distribution of
            possible Bitcoin prices at the end of the simulation period. Though
            a quantile is not an actually walked path, by examining different
            quantiles (e.g., 25th, 75th, 99th percentiles), users can gauge the
            range of best to worst-case scenarios and plan their financial
            strategies accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Q: How do different walk strategies impact the outcomes of the
              simulations?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Different walk strategies follow waypoints, paths, logic, and other
            inputs to alter their course. Set the volatility to 0 to see how
            each walk operates without noise.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Q: What is the primary goal of this Bitcoin drawdown simulation?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary goal is to help Bitcoin holders intuit future financial
            scenarios where they might begin to draw on their Bitcoin holdings.
            By simulating different market conditions and personal spending
            requirements, users can better understand just how valuable their
            bitcoin is.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q: Who should use this simulation tool?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool is designed for people who save in bitcoin, people who are
            considering using their holdings as a source of regular income,
            financial planners advising on bitcoin, or anyone interested in
            understanding the long-term financial implications of holding and
            using Bitcoin. For all users, this tool does not in any way
            constitute financial advice. Please speak with a licensed financial
            planner before making any financial decisions. Further, this tool
            does not apply in any way to other media beside bitcoin. Especially
            media that has no future such as every other currency or
            cryptocurrency.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Q: How accurate are the predictions made by the Monte Carlo
              simulation?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Monte Carlo simulation provides a robust model by
            considering thousands of possible outcomes, all predictions are
            hypothetical and based on user assumptions which will undoubtedly be
            proven wrong. That said, being based on historical data, statistical
            assumptions, and pure random number generation, makes it a powerful
            tool to be used along with many other such tools in financial
            planning. Again consult with a financial planner.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Q: Can this tool predict the future price of Bitcoin?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            No. The tool is not designed to predict exact future prices but
            rather to offer scenarios based on different inputs and shed light
            on probabilities around those assumptions. It helps users understand
            risks under various conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Q: What are the limitations of this simulation tool?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Limitations include the reliance on historical data, which may not
            capture future market conditions accurately. The tool also assumes
            certain financial and economic conditions will remain constant,
            which may not be the case. The base assumption is that all models
            will be proven wrong, and thus many models are included. As such,
            the modeling assumes ergodicity to a fault, and this too, might
            prove wanting in time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q: How often is the data and model updated?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool scrapes the current daily price of bitcoin, and keeps a
            record of past prices. All other information is generated based on
