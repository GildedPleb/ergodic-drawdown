      What if you have low time preferences and instead of needing an item by a
      specific date, would rather wait to spend a specific amount of bitcoin?
      Enter One-Off Fiat Variable-Date Event type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the âž• button to add another drawdown event. Select Type: "One-Off
      Fiat Variable-Date", give it the name "Boat", enter $3,000,000 USD. Let's
      start with willing to spend 1 bitcoin. Leave the other fields as they are
      and click "Save". As you can see we now have a new drawdown event, but
      unlike other events this event has a strange shape and a range. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are only willing to spend a specific amount of bitcoin, and can
      wait, that means that your spend date will be different for each sample
      and may be price improved. To get a better sense of Start and Delay, check
      out the FAQ below.

    <p>
      Now that we have a strong sense of our drawdown options, it's time to talk
      about inflation.
