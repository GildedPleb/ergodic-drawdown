      This is the pure walk pattern without any randomness. Try different walks
      using the selector (Model â–¼, Walk Strategy). Some collapse to straight
      lines when volatility is zero, showing how they depend more on volatility,
      not bounds. This is easiest to see in non-S2F models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some walks, like the Bubble Walk, are "ergodic" - given enough time,
      they'll hit every possible level in their range. This is crucial because
      it means objective, intra-cycle patterns can be reflected into future
      modeling. Unlike simpler models (e.g., Rainbow, Power Law), this egodicity
      gives us dimensionality to our modeling. This is the first categorical
      differentiation that sets this modeling paradigm apart.

    <p>
      Now, let's increase the volatility back to 0.1 - either click{" "}
      <strong>Next</strong> or set it manually before moving forward.
