      We now see the quantile distribution of price and our single drawdown
      event. Hover at the chart's end to see the final median and specific
      quantiles. Consider: what's the worst possible drawdown from a $2,000,000
      house purchase given the price assumptions? With these probability, is it
      worth it?
    </p>
    <p>
      To explore further, click "El Salvador Vacation Home" in Drawdown â–¼. In
      the modal, change Currency to BTC and Amount Today to 1, then Save. Notice
      how the quantiles collapse since it's now in bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try unchecking "Expense" to see it as an acquisition. Switch back to
      $2,000,000 USD to view the upside spread.

      Click <strong>Next</strong> to reset and learn about adding new drawdown
      events.
