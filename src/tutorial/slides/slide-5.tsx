      As you can see, one semi-chaotic, non-random price projection is now shown
      that roughly follows (but does not strictly respect) the shape of the
      guard-rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pattern is called a 'walk', it is how the price might 'step' through
      the range while remaining path-dependent on its previous step. Of course,
      this is only 1 possible future of an infinite amount of futures, but
      before we get into that, let's do what we can to fully understand this
      singular walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This path seems to follow a noisy up-down pattern. You may have suspected
      that there seems to be an underlying shape to this walk. Well, there is!
      To see the shape, let's remove all the volatility by clicking{" "}
      <strong>Next</strong> which will set the volatility to 0 (Model â–¼,
      Volatility: 0).
