      From initial conception to completion, this project represents about six
      years worth of research, testing, spreadsheets, think-boi walks, and
      coding, drawing from our experience in financial planning, engagement with
      financial markets, academic studies in economics, deep software
      engineering expertise, human-centered design work, and pursuit of Bitcoin.
