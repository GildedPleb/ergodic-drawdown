Things to do:

- add expected halving dates
- add some kind of FAQ/ToolTip/Explainer
- When calendar is set to today, its still fucked up a bit.
- Figure out a way to persist user settings that is private and that can not be "hacked"
- Figure out a way to share the settings in a link.
- Add a TODAY annotation that deliniates a seperation between past and future.
- Fix the bug that is present on the Random Walk where values below 0 never line up when using calculate the price amount thing only occures when you increase the epoch length
- when you force a rerender (maybe on ctl+s) it adds another epoch
- when you toggle the render, it should clear the dataset.
