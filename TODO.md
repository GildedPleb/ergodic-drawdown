Things to do:

- Figure out a way to share the settings in a link.
- Add a TODAY annotation that deliniates a seperation between past and future.
- if bitcoin goes to Zero, find which date it does so on.
- add markers for when events start and stop
- Add an option on price modeling where hitting 0 is fatal.
- Add the ability for a variable drawdown that is tied to % of total. Thus being able to model the 4% rule.
- When set to Random Walk, it looks like one of the quantiles converges with Max Price line. INvestigate this, cus this shoudl not be the case.
- Add a `priceImproved` flag to OneOffVariableFiat items. Prresently it would be activated by default, but if we de-activated it, it would ensure that a variable drawdown that we are willing to spend 1BTC on will _always_ remove 1BTC from holdings, on a date that it is affordable to do so. This would make the drawdown graph pretty. To do this, we need to re-implament variable-drawdown-cache and variable drawdown final. We need to add a new column (boolean) as the flag, and shorten the week column from a Float64 to a Uint32 or UInt16. By doing this, we add a feature and reduce memory footprint! Woudl then off course need to pipe a new state setting throw everythign, but coudl be fun!
- when in mobil mode, opening Model and Render pains should toggle each other so only 1 can be open at a time.
- the bottom should have:
  - copyright, legal, privacy, contact, source, FAQ,
- Add info buttons where appropriate. Model, Walks,
- this needs to be deployed on netlify with apporpriate HTTPS headers for using SharedArrayBuffers
- add annotations that show when a drawdown starts / ends / type / name on the graph.
- improve the bubble walk
- alter as many existing walks as possible to not be clamped, like SIn and Random presently are.
- allow user to move the Add Drawdown Event modal when in desktop mode
- Do the full TUTORIAL
- Add the new MODE: solve for X ... as in, I want to retire in 2050, that means i'll need Y bitcoin today. Or better, "I want 1 bitcoin left over, with 90% probability, how many do i need to start?"
- add a new MODEL: S curve / hyperinflation
- full performance audit
- On Mobile, when you expand Model or Render, it should collapse Drawdown. On Desktop it should stay as is.
- Remove leading 0s in all inputs
- Firefox allocs max-array upfront and does not memory clear it. It might be better to force firefox to use set-size arrays.
- If you try and hit "delete" on an entered date, it kills the page.
- crosshair at mouse option, draw line / vertical / horizontal / box / text box
- when you tab into a drawdown content table cell, you shoudl be able to hit enter to enter the cell, same with any other buttons and tabbing also escape shoudl exit modal.
