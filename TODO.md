Things to do:

- Figure out a way to persist user settings that is private and that can not be "hacked"
- Figure out a way to share the settings in a link.
- Add a TODAY annotation that deliniates a seperation between past and future.
- if bitcoin goes to Zero, find which date it does so on.
- add markers for when events start and stop
- maybe put the visualization options superimposed on the graph
- Make column titles: instead of "Starts" in every column "Starts" should only be on the top and thats it.
- Re-organize everything
- Add an option on price modeling where hitting 0 is fatal.
