Things to do:

- add expected halving dates
- add some kind of FAQ/ToolTip/Explainer
- Figure out a way to persist user settings that is private and that can not be "hacked"
- Figure out a way to share the settings in a link.
- Add a TODAY annotation that deliniates a seperation between past and future.
- when you force a rerender (maybe only on ctl+s) it adds another epoch
