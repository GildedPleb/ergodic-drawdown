Things to do:

- Figure out a way to persist user settings that is private and that can not be "hacked"
- Figure out a way to share the settings in a link.
- Add a TODAY annotation that deliniates a seperation between past and future.
- BUG: when you force a rerender (maybe only on ctl+s) it adds another epoch
- mobile is rekt???
- if bitcoin goes to Zero, find which date it does so on.
- Like the Price Worker, the Volume Worker only needs to re-calculate all volumes when certain--but not all--parameters change. FOr instance, it does not need to recalcuate all epochs when a new epoch is added.
